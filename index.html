    <p>Albert Einstein 14 March 1879 - 18 April 1955 was a German-born theoretical physicist. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics, and thus to modern physics. His mass - energy equivalence formula E=mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.</p>

      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist widely recognized for his groundbreaking contributions to the field of physics. He is best known for his theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The theory of relativity consists of two major parts: the special theory of relativity, published in 1905, and the general theory of relativity, published in 1915. These theories laid the foundation for modern physics and had a profound impact on the scientific community.

        Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. He displayed a keen interest in mathematics and physics from an early age. After completing his education at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, Einstein worked as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office.
      </p>
      <p>
        During his time at the patent office, Einstein continued to explore scientific concepts and published several groundbreaking papers that contributed to his rise as a renowned physicist.

      <p>
        In 1903, Albert Einstein married Mileva Marić, a fellow physicist. They had two sons together. However, their relationship faced numerous challenges, and they eventually divorced in 1919.

      <h2>Miracle Year</h2>
      <p>
        In 1905, often referred to as Einstein's "miracle year," he published several groundbreaking papers that transformed the field of physics. These papers introduced concepts such as the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, and the theory of special relativity. Einstein's achievements during this year propelled him to international acclaim and solidified his status as a leading scientific figure.

      <p>
        Albert Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. In 1921, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which laid the groundwork for quantum theory. However, his contributions to the theory of relativity were not explicitly recognized by the Nobel Committee.

    <blockquote>
        <p>
          "A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.”
